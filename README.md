# Destiny Text Adventure Game

This Repository is for a working version of my [Destiny RPG Game](https://github.com/VictoriaT87/Destiny_RPG), that has been split into multiple files.
This game works when run, however the loading time is around 10 seconds when deployed to Heroku. 
Because of this long loading time, it made the game feel like it was not working correctly, as the game was hanging on loading.
I have since reverted back into 1 file structure as my main Project submission, however I would like to come back to this to
try and understand better why the load time was so slow.
